Task 1: Even or Odd
This task prompts the user to enter an integer number and determines whether the entered number is even or odd. The program uses the modulus operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 2. If the remainder is zero, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd. The result is then displayed to the user.

Task 2: Total Sum from 1 to N Using a For Loop
In this task, the user is prompted to enter a positive integer N. The program then calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to N using a for loop. At each iteration of the loop, the current integer is added to a running total. After the loop completes, the program displays the calculated sum to the user.
